/**
 * Calculates the exact active days ratio by looking at the subscription billing cycle and the from_timestamp.
 *
 * Example case:
 * For a monthly subscription, the active_days_ratio for a resource with 61 days_active in a 61 day period previously would result in 1.
 * This meant that the cost for 2 month was only 1 * line_item_total. If the subscription's billing period is monthly, the ratio should be 2 so that the cost of the resource for 61 days is 2x the line item total.
 *
 * To help with the calculations, using the from_timestamp allows us to calculate accurate days in the billing periods that are months and years. Without the from_timestamp there's no way to figure out whether a month counted in the days_in_period was 28,29 (feb in leap years),30 or 31 days. Accounting for the off by one or 2 extra days in Feb was not possible
 *
 * Using the total days active and the amount days in the period, we can calculate a ratio between 0 and 1 for days active in the period. Then we need multiple that value by the number of billing periods.
